The project is a simple weather application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's city. The app includes an automatic detection feature that identifies the user's city using their device's location services. Upon detection, the application retrieves the current weather data for that specific location and displays it to the user.

In addition to the automatic detection, the app also offers the functionality to search for weather information in other cities. Users can manually enter the name of a city in the search bar, and the application will retrieve and present the corresponding weather data.

The app utilizes reliable weather data APIs to fetch accurate and up-to-date information, ensuring the users receive the most relevant weather updates.
